# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
From the results of my analysis, it was confirmed that, delivery delays is actually a primary factor of negative customer reviews which in turn mostly leads to customer churn with average reviews dropping from 4.29 to 3.46 for late deliveries, and from 4.29 to 1.78 for sper late deliveries.
Furthermore, beyond immediate feedback, these logistics failures significantly damage customer retention, as first-time customers who experience delays are far less likely to return.
This suggests that, delivery inefficiencies and ineffectiveness, actually affects brand reputation, customer retention which may in effect damage profitability.

# Project Brief: The "Last Mile" Logistics Auditor

**Client:** Veridi Logistics (Global E-Commerce Aggregator)  
**Deliverable:** Public Dashboard, Code Notebook & Insight Presentation

---

## 1. Business Context
**Veridi Logistics** manages shipping for thousands of online sellers. Recently, the CEO has noticed a spike in negative customer reviews. She has a "gut feeling" that the problem isn't just that packages are late, but that the estimated delivery dates provided to customers are wildly inaccurate (i.e., we are over-promising and under-delivering).

She needs you to audit the delivery data to find the root cause. She specifically wants to know: **"Are we failing specific regions, or is this a nationwide problem?"**

Your job is to build a "Delivery Performance" audit tool that connects the dots between **Logistics Data** (when a package arrived) and **Customer Sentiment** (how they rated the experience).

## 2. The Data
You will use the **Olist E-Commerce Dataset**, a real commercial dataset from a Brazilian marketplace. This is a relational database dump, meaning the data is split across multiple CSV files.

* **Source:** [Kaggle - Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
* **Key Files to Use:**
    * `olist_orders_dataset.csv` (The central table)
    * `olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv` (Sentiment)
    * `olist_customers_dataset.csv` (Location)
    * `olist_products_dataset.csv` (Categories)

## 3. Tooling Requirements
You have the flexibility to choose your development environment:

* **Option A (Recommended):** Use a cloud-hosted notebook like **Google Colab**, or **Deepnote**, etc.
* **Option B:** Use a local **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code**.
    * *Condition:* If you choose this, you must ensure your code is reproducible. Do not reference local file paths (e.g., `C:/Downloads/...`). Assume the dataset is in the same folder as your notebook.
* **Dashboarding:** The final output must be a **publicly accessible link** (e.g., Tableau Public, Google Looker Studio, Streamlit Cloud, or PowerBI Web, etc.).

## 4. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 1: The Schema Builder
**As a** Data Engineer,  
**I want** to join the Orders, Reviews, and Customers tables into a single master dataset,  
**So that** I can analyze a customer's location and their review score in the same row.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Load the raw CSVs into your notebook.
    * Perform the correct joins (e.g., join Reviews to Orders on `order_id`, join Customers to Orders on `customer_id`).
    * **Check:** Ensure you don't accidentally duplicate rows (a common error with 1-to-many joins).

### Story 2: The "Real" Delay Calculator
**As a** Logistics Manager,  
**I want** to know the difference between the "Estimated Delivery Date" and the "Actual Delivery Date,"  
**So that** I can see how often we are lying to customers.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Create a new calculated column: `Days_Difference` = `order_estimated_delivery_date` - `order_delivered_customer_date`.
    * Classify orders into statuses: "On Time", "Late", and "Super Late" (> 5 days late).
    * Handle missing values: Some orders were never delivered (`order_status` = 'canceled' or 'unavailable'). These should be excluded or flagged separately.

### Story 3: The Geographic Heatmap
**As a** Regional Director,  
**I want** to see which specific States (`customer_state`) have the highest percentage of late deliveries,  
**So that** I can focus my repair efforts on the worst regions.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Calculate the % of late orders per State.
    * Visualize this on a map or a bar chart.
    * **Insight:** Identify if "Remote" states (far from the distribution center) are disproportionately affected.

### Story 4: The Sentiment Correlation
**As a** Customer Success Lead,  
**I want** to see if late deliveries actually cause bad reviews,  
**So that** I can prove to the CEO that logistics is the problem.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Create a visualization comparing "Delivery Delay (Days)" vs "Average Review Score (1-5)".
    * Show the average review score for "On Time" orders vs. "Late" orders.

## 5. Bonus User Story: The "Translation" Challenge
**As a** Global Analyst,  
**I want** to see product categories in **English**, not Portuguese,  
**So that** I can understand if "Furniture" is harder to ship than "Electronics".

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * The `product_category_name` is in Portuguese (e.g., `cama_mesa_banho`).
    * Use the `product_category_name_translation.csv` file included in the dataset (or create your own mapping) to translate these into English for your final dashboard.

## 6. The "Candidate's Choice" Challenge
**As a** Creative Problem Solver,  
**I want** to include one extra feature or analysis that adds specific business value,  
**So that** I can demonstrate my ability to think beyond the basic requirements.

* **Instructions:**
    * Add one more metric, chart, or drill-down.
    * **Requirement:** You must justify *why* this feature matters to the business in your README.
